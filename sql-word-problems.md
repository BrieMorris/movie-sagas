## SQL Word Problems


***WIP***
## ERD
Make an ERD of the tables we have.

## SQL
How would you get all movies with the 'adventure' genre? Use adventure's `id`.

How would you see how many movies each genre has? Make sure you get back all the genres!

How would you add an existing genre to a movie?

How would you remove a genre from a movie?


## Stretch
How would you get all movies and all of their genres, but only one row per movie? (For example, pn the list page we want to see all the movies and all of the movies' genres that apply)
> There're a few ways to do this, do research on ARRAY_AGG or JSON_AGG

How would you delete a Movie that has genres?
> You may need to check out the ON DELETE CASCADE for the table columns...
